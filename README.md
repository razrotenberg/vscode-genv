# GPU Environment Management for Visual Studio Code

The [_genv_](https://github.com/run-ai/genv) extension lets you interactively control, configure and monitor the GPU resources that your Visual Studio Code session is using.

Make sure to read the _genv_ [reference](https://github.com/run-ai/genv#usage) to get started.
Plus, you will have to [install](https://github.com/run-ai/genv#installation) it first on your machine (don't worry, it takes 10 seconds).
